  /**
   * Evaluating a rule's conditionSet requires some arguments, like the content
   * against which you want to evaluate the conditions (see RuleInput).
   *
   * However, in addition to these data arguments, running a rule also requires
   * various "capabilities", e.g., the ability to evaluate a signal for some
   * value (as required by one of the rule's conditions) and the ability to
   * compute derived values from the content.
   *
   * For these "capabilities", we may want to retain some state between from one
   * rule evaluation to the next, for the purpose of caching. E.g., if multiple
   * conditions (in the same rule, or across rules) run the same signal against
   * the same input, we'd like to be able to cache and reuse that result.
   * Similarly, if multiple conditions reference the same derived field, we'd
   * like to only have to compute its value once.
   *
   * The scope of this cache -- e.g., is it distributed, in a way all api
   * servers can access? if not, and it just lives in one server's memory, does
   * it persist across requests to that server (and expire on a TTL), or does it
   * get created at the start of some request/unit of work and discarded at the
   * end? -- is likely to change over time, as we evolve the system.
   *
   * For now, though, we have an explicit object that holds this cached state,
   * and which is expected to be created at the start of some unit of work (like
   * a rule set execution) and then discarded shortly thereafter. That object is
   * a "rule execution context", and it's what's returned here. Because, again,
   * this concept may change over time, I'm treating it as a detail of the
   * RuleEngine, by having the RuleEngine be the only code (in the method below)
   * that can create the context (using an opaque type), and the only code that
   * will consume it.
   *
   * As implied by this method's arguments, a context cannot be reused across
   * different RuleInputs/different item submissions, in part to help enforce
   * that these objects be short-lived, but also because the RuleInput data
   * contributes to the cache keys used within the evaluation context (e.g., for
   * `getDerivedFieldValue`).
