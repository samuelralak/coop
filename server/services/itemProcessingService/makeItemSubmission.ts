/**
 * An "item" represents a logical _entity_ on the user's platform. In this
 * context, an entity specifically refers to something with a fixed identity but
 * mutable state. For example, a user would be an item, as it's still "the same"
 * user, even if they change their username or profile picture.
 *
 * Because an item's state can change over time -- e.g., a post's content can
 * get edited; a user can change their profile pic; etc -- we also have a
 * concept representing "an item with its current data as sent to Coop at some
 * point in time". That's what an "item submission" is, conceptually.
 *
 * However, when an item with its (current) data is submitted to Coop, it comes
 * in without any validation or normalization having been performed on it. So,
 * we use the `RawItemSubmission` to represent items in this state.
 *
 * Then, once the item has been validated and normalized, and we've assigned it
 * an id, filled in some legacy properties (like `creator`), etc., we use the
 * `ItemSubmission` type below to represent that.
 *
 * This type should only be instantiated through either the
 * {@link rawItemSubmissionToItemSubmission} or the
 * {@link submissionDataToItemSubmission} functions below, in order to ensure
 * that the ItemSubmission is instantiated correctly, with validation, a proper
 * id, etc. See those functions for details.

     * way to _order_ submissions so that, when rendering an item to the
     * user (e.g., in the thread summary in MRT), we can show the submission
     * for that item that has the most up-to-date data.
     *
     * If we assume that, whenenver a user submits an item to us, they're
     * submitting the most recent version's of the item's data, then the
     * submission with the most recent data will also be the one we received
     * most recently, so we can show that one. We track this with
     * `submissionTime`.
     *
     * Strictly speaking, the assumption that the user will always submit
     * the latest version of an item's data is unsafe, if the user generates
     * submissions from multiple data systems that are themselves only
     * eventually consistent. However, the only workaround for that would be for
     * us to allow users to provide a field in the item data indicating its
     * version, and we don't currently have a schema field role for that;
     * moreover, even if we did, it would be optional for users to use it,
     * so we're always gonna want to use submission time as a baseline ordering
     * scheme.
     *
     * Submission time is optional because we'd have to do some semi-involved
     * data warehouse migrations to populate it on existing submissions. However, the
     * intention is to store it for all new submissions going forward (although
     * that's unfortunately difficult to enforce). Submissions for the same item
     * without a `submissionTime` have undefined ordering.
     *
     * NB: Submission time is very different from the "created at" time given in
     * the item's data. "Created at" represents when the item was created -- not
     * when it was submitted to us -- so, if the item is edited by an end user
     * on the platform side, it's "created at" should not change (if the
     * user is populating that field correctly). I.e., all the submissions
     * for a given item should actually have the same created at -- which is
     * critical for keeping items properly positioned in a thread after they're
     * edited -- but different submission times.
