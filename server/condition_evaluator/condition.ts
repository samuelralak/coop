/**
 * @fileoverview Helper functions for the abstract Condition concept
 * (i.e., a Condition could be a ConditionSet or a LeafCondition).
 *
 * NB: We could avoid the need for much of this if we used a more OO approach
 * and let dynamic dispatch figure out whether to call, e.g, ConditionSet.run()
 * or LeafCondition.run(), but then we'd have to marshall all our condition JSON
 * data into class instances and likely mutate those instances as we got results.
 *
 * I think I'd rather have some `isConditionSet` checks than switch into a
 * mutable OO paradigm (and add a lot of boilerplate marshalling). Still, maybe
 * there's a version of that that's worth it? Or some better way to encapsulate
 * the traversal logic, while keeping the functional paradigm? `isConditionSet`
 * is leaking out a lot of places...
