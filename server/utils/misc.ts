/**
 * This function merges the data from patch into object. It's very similar to
 * `Object.assign` _except_ that if the `patch` has an enumerable, own property
 * whose value is undefined, then the property from the `patch` is ignored and
 * the original value from `object` (if any) is left in place. Object.assign, by
 * contrast, would copy the value `undefined`. It's also similar to lodash's
 * merge, except it's not recursive.
 *
 * This is useful for working with GraphQL argument objects, where we
 * might pick some subset of known argument names into a new object, but give
 * them an undefined value in the process. E.g., imagine `someQuery(id: true)`,
 * where `id` is not mutable, and there are also optional arguments `y` and `z`.
 * So, the original args argument looked like `{ id: true }` and simply had no
 * key for `y` or `z`. But, if we do `{ id, y, z } = args`, and then
 * `patchInPlace(await getObjectById(id), { y, z })`, suddenly there are keys
 * for `y` and `z`, just with undefined values that we want to ignore.
 *
 * @param object The object to mutate by assigning the patch's fields to it.
 * @param patch An object of fields to set on the object.
 * @returns

/**
 * Gets the value of a property at a path, but short-circuits if any key along
 * the way isn't found. It's like `?.`, except it returns a magic symbol to
 * represent the None/short circuit case, so you can differentiate that from the
 * property's value actually being null or undefined.
 *
 * This function is also much more convenient than `?.` when handling `unknown`
 * values with TS (as you'd get in a catch block, where nothing's guaranteed
 * about the thrown value), as TS won't let you do `unknownValue?.someProp` even
 * though this can't crash at runtime (even if the LHS is a primitive) and
 * should probably just produce `unknown`.
 *
 * For example, imagine you have some value `err` that's `unknown`, but you
 * expect it might well be `{ response: { status: number } }`, and you want to
 * check something like `e.response.status === 500`. Doing this in a way that TS
 * will accept is incredibly cumbersome, and requires:
 *
 * ```ts
 * if(typeof e === 'object' && e !== null &&
 *    typeof (e as { response?: unknown }).response === 'object' &&
 *    (e as { response: { status?: unknown } | null }).response !== null &&
 *    (e as { response: { status?: unknown } }).response.status === 500) {
 *     // ok
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * No sane person would write the above. Instead, one can do
 * `safeGet(e, ['response', 'status'])`.

 * This takes a retry policy and a function and returns a version of the

 *
 * @param retryPolicy.maxRetries - The maximum number of times to retry the

 * @param retryPolicy.initialTimeMsBetweenRetries - How long to wait after the
 *   first failure before retrying, in milliseconds.
 * @param retryPolicy.maxTimeMsBetweenRetries - The maximum time to wait between
 *   retries, in milliseconds. This can be useful b/c the time between retries
 *   grows by defualt, to implement the standard exponential backoff pattern.
 * @param retryPolicy.jitter - Whether to randomly vary the time between retries
 *   slightly, to prevent many retrying clients that are all using the same
 *   (standard) exponential backoff strategy from inadvertently overloading the
 *   service/resource that the function requires. Jitter is implemented as full
 *   jitter as defined here by AWS:
 *   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/
 * @param retryPolicy.nextRetryWaitTimeMultiple - How much to multiply the wait
 *   time from the last retry to determine the wait time for the next retry.
 *   This defaults to 2 -- i.e., the wait time doubles between retries -- which
 *   gives the standard exponential backoff behavior.
 * @param retryPolicy.isRetryableError - If the function being subject to
 *   retries returns a promise that rejects, the rejection could've been because
 *   of an error that is not retryable, in which case the retry process should
 *   bail early. This option accepts a predicate function that receives the
 *   rejection value and returns whether the error is retryable. By default, all
 *   errors are considered retryable.
 * @param fn The function that will be run and retried as needed.
 * @returns A version of the function with automatic retries.
